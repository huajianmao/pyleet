#
# DESC:
# =====
# Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
#
# A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
#
# Example:
# X X X X
# X O O X
# X X O X
# X O X X
#
# After running your function, the board should be:
# X X X X
# X X X X
# X X X X
# X O X X
#
# Explanation:
# Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border,
# which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'.
# Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'.
# Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
